Two house holds, both a like in dignity,		In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,			Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.			From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,		A pair of star-cross''d lovers take their life;			Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.		Do with their death bury their parent's strife.
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;
Whose miss adventured piteous overthrows
Do with their death bury their parent's strife.
