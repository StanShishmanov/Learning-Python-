Listmon’s Monsters
Input / Constraints
An evil genius never works alone.  Listmon has own army. He wants to start tracking data for his army. You have been asked to create a data base for Listmon's monsters.
A basic monster will always  have:
•	name -  string of any asci character without space and comma 
•	id  – integer number
•	strength - integer point number
•	ugliness - integer number
In his army he accepts only two types of monsters: Hydralisks and Zerglings. Both types has the same parameters as a basic monsters but also:
•	Hydralisk has another property – range - string of any asci character without space and comma
•	Zergling has another property – speed – integer number
Listmon does not get in his army basic monsters. They must be one of the two types mentioned above.
You will start receiving input data in format:
* Hydralisk({name}, {id}, {strength}, {ugliness}, {range})
-if there is no fifth parameter you should print '__init__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'range''
-if the fifth parameter is not a string you should print 'Range must be string'
In both cases you do not add the monster in DB
* Zergling({name}, {id}, {strength}, {ugliness}, {speed})
-if there is no fifth parameter you should print '__init__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'speed''
-if the fifth parameter is not a string you should print 'Speed must be integer’
In both cases you do not add the monster in DB
Is it possible a basic monster to try to apply in the army. If you receive a command:
*BasicMonster({name}, {id}, { strength }, {ugliness})
You must print ‘Can't instantiate abstract class BaseMonster with abstract methods __init__’  and you must  not add it in the DB.

 - Overall speed of army: {speed}
 - Overall strength: {strength}
 - Hydralisk: {count}; Zergling: {count}
Where {speed} is the sum of all Zerglings monsters speed in DB;
{strength} is the sum of strength of all monsters;
{count} is the number of all Hydralisks/Zerglings in the DB

Input						Output
Zergling('Pesho', 10, 10, 10, 10)		Overall speed of army: 60
Zergling('Pesho', 10, 10, 10, 20)		Overall stength: 130
Hydralisk('a', 100, 100, 100, 'min')		Hydralisk: 1; Zergling: 3
Zergling('Pesho', 10, 10, 10, 30)
