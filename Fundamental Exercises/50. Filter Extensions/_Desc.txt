You will receive a folder called input, with various files with custom extensions. You may add or remove the files as you wish, but they are the only way to test your code.
Write a program which accepts a single input line from the Console, holding an extension … like: "txt", "bmp", "rar" etc.
Print the NAMES AND EXTENSIONS of all files, which have the given extension.
