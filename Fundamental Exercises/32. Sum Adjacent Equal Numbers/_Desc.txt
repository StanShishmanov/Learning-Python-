Write a program to sum all adjacent equal numbers in a list of decimal numbers, starting from left to right.
 - After two numbers are summed, the obtained result could be equal to some of its neighbors and should be
summed as well (see the examples below).
 - Always sum the leftmost two equal neighbors (if several couples of equal neighbors are available).
