Exercises are fun … Especially when they represent a problem from your exercises.
Implement a class Exercise, which has a topic (string), a course_name (string), a judge_contest_link (string), and
problems (collection of strings).
You will receive several input lines containing information about a single exercise in the following format:
{topic} -> {course_name} -> {judge_contest_link} -> {problem1}, {problem2}. . .
You need to store every exercise in a Collection of Exercises. When you receive the command “go go go”, you end
the input sequence.
You must print every exercise, in the following format:
“Exercises: {topic}
Problems for exercises and homework for the "{course_name}" course @ SoftUni.
Check your solutions here: {judge_contest_link}
1. {problem1}
2. {problem2}
. . .”
