Write a Python program, which reads information about a person in the same format as the previous problem, and prints it back to the console with the following format:
Name: {name}
Age: {age}
Town: {town}
Salary: ${salary}
Age range: {ageRange}
Salary range: {salaryRange}
Format the salary to the 2nd decimal point.
The age range is as follows:
 - If the person is less than 18 years old, they are a “teen”
 - If the person is less than 70 years old, they are an “adult”
 - Otherwise, the person is an “elder”
The salary range is as follows:
 - If the salary is less than $500, it is “low”
 - If the salary is less than $2000, it is “medium”
 - Otherwise, the salary is “high”
