You have been tasked to create a program which represents a Console interface for creating HTML files.
Every HTML file naturally holds the following elements:
"<!DOCTYPE html>"
<head>
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>"
You will need to add them at the end in order to form the file.
You will start receiving input lines in the following format:
{tag} {content}
You should generate a string from every input line – like this: <{tag}>{content}</{tag}> …
If the tag is &quot;title&quot; you should add the generated string between the <head> and </head> tags with a tabulation (<\t>) before it.
If you receive the <title> tag MORE than ONCE, you should CHANGE its value.

In any other case you should APPEND the generated string between the <body> and </body> tags with a
tabulation ("\t") before it.
When you receive the command &quot;exit&quot; the input ends. The content you have generated should be stored in a file
called "index.html" (.html extension).
